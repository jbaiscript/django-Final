## Testing Sequence (Recommended)

1. Register a customer account
2. Register a seller account
3. Login as seller
4. Create products
5. Create discount days
6. Logout and login as customer
7. Create orders (with products that may have discount days)
8. Test inventory reduction
9. Login as seller again
10. Check seller statistics
11. Update product stock
12. Test all endpoints with invalid data to verify error handling

## Notes
- Stock quantities are automatically reduced when orders are placed
- Discount days only apply to orders placed on the same date
- Only sellers can create and manage discount days
- Admin users have additional access to user management endpoints
- Image uploads for products require form-data instead of JSON
